Encountering a "This page isn’t working" error when opening a link in a new tab can stem from several causes. Start by verifying the URL for typos or formatting issues, as even minor errors can break the link. Check if the website is temporarily down using tools like DownDetector or by accessing it on another device or network. Clear your browser’s cache and cookies, as corrupted data might interfere with loading the page, or try a different browser to rule out local software conflicts. Temporarily disable VPNs, proxies, or browser extensions that could block access. If the problem persists, the issue may lie with the website’s server—contact the site administrator for support or wait and try again later.
