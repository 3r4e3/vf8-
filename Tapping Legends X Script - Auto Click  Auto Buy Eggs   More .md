<h1>Tapping Legends X Script - Auto Click, Auto Buy Eggs & More</h1>

"Tapping Legends X" is a popular game on platforms like Roblox, where players tap to earn currency and upgrade their characters or pets. A "script" in this context typically refers to a piece of code that can be used to automate actions in the game, such as earning currency faster or unlocking features without manual effort.

Scripts are often created using Lua, the programming language used by Roblox, and can be executed using exploit tools. However, using scripts or exploits can violate the game's terms of service, potentially leading to account bans or other penalties.
