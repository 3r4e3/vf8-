If you're encountering a "This page isn't working" error after pasting a link in a new tab, start by verifying the URL for typos or formatting issues. If the link is correct, the problem might be temporary‚Äîrefresh the page or check if the website is down using services like DownDetector. Clearing your browser‚Äôs cache and cookies or trying an incognito window can resolve conflicts caused by stored data. Test the link in a different browser or device to rule out local issues, and ensure your internet connection is stable. If you‚Äôre using a VPN or firewall, temporarily disable them to check for access restrictions. If these steps fail, contact the website‚Äôs support team for further assistance, as the issue could be server-related. Let me know if you need more guidance! üôè
